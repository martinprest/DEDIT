# DEDIT
Diary tool for Psion Organiser II XP

An editor for diary entries, which lists them in ascending chronological order.
Provides functions such as: Edit, Delete and Find, plus Anniv for copying anniversaries to the following year.
Compatible with the main Organiser DIARY and Jaap's year 2000 fix.
DEDIT can be used as an alternative to the main DIARY, although not all functions are reproduced (Tidy from DIARY is quite useful).
As a precaution, use the Save function of the main DIARY before installing DEDIT, and to periodically backup your diary!

See readme-DEDIT.txt for further information
