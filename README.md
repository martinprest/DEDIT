# DEDIT
Diary tool for Psion Organiser II XP

A diary browser and editor, which lists entries in chronological order.
Provides functions such as: Edit, Copy, Delete and Find.
Compatible with the main Organiser DIARY and Jaap's year 2000 fix.
DEDIT works a bit like the LIST option in the main DIARY, except that it allows to edit diary entries.

As a precaution, use the Save function of the main DIARY before installing DEDIT, and to periodically backup your diary!

See readme-DEDIT.txt for further information
